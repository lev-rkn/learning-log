Learning Log is a web application that lets users track their learning journey.  The homepage provides an overview of the site, inviting users to either register for an account or log in. 

Once logged in, users can:

* Create new topics:  Define their areas of interest, whether it's coding, history, music, or anything else.
* Add entries:  Document their progress, insights, and questions related to each topic.
* Read and edit existing entries:  Review past entries, update them, or add new information as their understanding grows.
